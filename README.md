Project Structure
The project is divided into two main folders:

Backend: Contains all the ASP.NET files, including the middleware and database logic.
Frontend: Contains all the React files, including the user interface and frontend logic.
Backend (ASP.NET)
ASP.NET Version: 3.1.12
Database: PostgreSQL
The backend is responsible for handling all database operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also serves as the middleware, handling requests and responses between the frontend and database.

Frontend (React)
React Version: ^18.3.1
UI Library: "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free": "^6.6.0", "bootstrap": "^5.3.3".
The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It handles all client-side logic, including rendering components, handling user input, and making requests to the backend.

Database (PostgreSQL)
PostgreSQL Version: Postgres 16
The database is built using PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system. It stores all data for the application, including user information, settings, and other relevant data.
